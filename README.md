# REST APIs
REST is an architectural style based on web-standards and HTTP protocol. 
REST was first described by Roy Fielding in 2000.
In a REST based architecture everything is a resource. A resource is accessed via a common interface based on the HTTP standard methods.
In a REST based architecture you typically have a REST server which provides access to the resources and a REST client which accesses and modifies the REST resources.
Every resource should support the HTTP common operations.
Resources are identified by global IDs (which are typically URIs).
REST allows that resources have different representations, e.g., text, XML, JSON etc.
The REST client can ask for a specific representation via the HTTP protocol (content negotiation).
